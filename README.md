## üöÄ Getting Started

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git (optional but recommended)

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Lucifer481/Phishing-Link-Detection-using-ML

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Phishing-Link-Detection-using-ML

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


---

## üß™ Usage

To run the phishing detection system:


python {entrypoint}

> streamlit run src/app.py

Once running, you can:

* Use the web interface in your browser (`http://localhost:5000` by default)
* Interact with API endpoints via tools like Postman or `curl`
* Test URLs directly from the browser extension (if installed)

---

## üß´ Testing

This project uses `{test_framework}` for testing.

Run the test suite with:


pytest


> Make sure the test framework and all dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
